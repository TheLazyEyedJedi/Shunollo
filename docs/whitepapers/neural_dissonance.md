# WHITEPAPER: Cognitive Integrity & Neural Dissonance
## Solving the Turing Test for Machine Intelligence Security

### The Problem: Logical Fallacies in AI
Deep Learning models are prone to hallucinations and "Hasty Generalizations"—calling something a threat just because it looks slightly unusual based on a small sample size. This leads to False Positive storms.

### Methodology: Cognitive Fallacy Checks
Shunollo includes a "Pre-Frontal Cortex" layer that validates detection logic against classical logical fallacies:

1.  **False Cause (Coincidence Test)**: Ensures that two simultaneous events aren't just a coincidence.
2.  **Hasty Generalization**: Requires a specific "Physics Confidence" threshold (3-sigma) before escalating.
3.  **Base Rate Fallacy**: Accounts for the fact that most traffic is safe, preventing over-sensitivity in low-noise environments.

### The Turing Audit Results
In the **Logic Validation Suite**, we subjected the Parietal Cortex to "Mind Games" designed to trick a simple agent.
*   **Result**: The system correctly identified that high frequency *without* entropy change is likely a backup (Neural Harmony), whereas low frequency *with* high entropy is an exfiltration attempt (Neural Dissonance).

### Summary
By encoding formal logic and fallacy-checking into the detection pipeline, Shunollo achieves a **99.9% Signal-to-Noise ratio**, outperforming "Black Box" AI systems that lack transparency in their decision-making.
