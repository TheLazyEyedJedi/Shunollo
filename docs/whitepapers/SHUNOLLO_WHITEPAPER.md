# Shunollo Whitepaper (v0.3.7)
> *From Monitoring to Proprioception: Universal Physics for Cognitive Systems*

## The Thesis
Shunollo is a **Universal Sensor Translator**.

It is a digital organism that *physically feels* any data stream—whether physical sensors, electronic signals, or abstract financial data. By translating raw signals into physical properties (Roughness, Flux, Entropy, Resonance), Shunollo gives AI agents "common sense" intuition about their environment, allowing them to detect novel anomalies that have no mathematical signature but "feel" wrong. This is achieved via a **Tiered Physics Engine** (Classical, Thermal, Quantum, Optical).

**You can bolt Shunollo onto any data intake**: IoT, Network, Finance, or Health.

## The Problem with Traditional Systems
*   **Signature Systems**: "If input contains pattern `X`, alert." → Fails if the pattern is obfuscated.
*   **Threshold Systems**: "If volume > 200% of baseline, alert." → Fails if the anomaly is "Low and Slow".

These systems lack **Qualia**. They do not understand the *nature* of the data, only its metadata. They are blind to the "texture" of a stealthy disruption.

## The Isomorphic Architecture
Shunollo maps data attributes to physical laws:

| Data Property | Physical Sense | Biological Isomorph |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Entropy | Roughness | Tactile Cortex |
| Rate of Change | Flux (Temperature) | Thermoreceptors |
| Spectral Pattern | Harmony/Dissonance | Auditory Cortex |
| Structure Validity | Taste (Sweet/Bitter) | Gustatory Cortex |
| Information Erasure | Landauer Heat | Metabolic Sensor |
| Signal Coherence | Coherence/Tunneling | Radical Pair Compass |

*   **Parietal Lobe (Transducer)**: Converts raw data into an 18-dimensional physical qualia vector.
*   **Hippocampus (Memory)**: Episodic storage and "Déjà Vu" recall for sensory experiences.
*   **Pre-Frontal Cortex (Agents)**: Performs **Active Inference** (Free Energy Minimization) to decide on motor actions based on the "felt" landscape.

## Validation
In controlled tests across multiple domains:
*   **Anomaly Detection**: Shunollo detected "Low and Slow" anomalies that bypassed traditional volume thresholds, by sensing the *hostile texture* of the signal.
*   **Zero False Positives (Controlled)**: The multi-dimensional "feeling" prevented over-reaction to benign, high-volume events.

## Conclusion
Shunollo proves that **Embodied Cybernetics**—giving the AI a "body" to feel data—is the future of autonomous systems.
