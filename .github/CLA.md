# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

**Shunollo Project**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Shunollo. To clarify the intellectual property license granted with contributions, we require contributors to sign this Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

## Terms

By submitting a pull request or other contribution to the Shunollo project, you agree to the following:

1. **Grant of License**: You grant Shunollo Labs and its successors a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, sublicense, and distribute your contribution as part of the Shunollo project.

2. **Open Source Commitment**: Your contribution will be distributed under the Apache 2.0 license, the same license as the rest of the project.

3. **Original Work**: You represent that your contribution is your original work, or you have sufficient rights to submit it under these terms.

4. **No Warranty**: You provide your contribution "as is" without warranties of any kind.

## Why a CLA?

Even for fully open-source projects, a CLA protects both the project and contributors by:
- Ensuring clear licensing of all contributions
- Protecting contributors from future liability claims
- Allowing the project to defend against license violations

## How to Sign

By submitting a pull request, you indicate your acceptance of these terms.
